Conda-Pack
==========

|Build Status| |Conda Badge| |PyPI Badge|

``conda-pack`` is a command line tool for creating relocatable conda
environments. This is useful for deploying code in a consistent environment,
potentially in a location where python/conda isn't already installed.

See the `documentation <https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/>`_ for more
