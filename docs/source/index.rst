Conda-Pack
==========

``conda-pack`` is a command line tool for creating archives of `conda
environments <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ that can be installed on other
systems and locations. This is useful for deploying code in a consistent
environmentâ€”potentially where python and/or conda isn't already installed.

A tool like ``conda-pack`` is necessary because conda environments *are
not relocatable*. Simply moving an environment to a different directory
can render it partially or completely inoperable. ``conda-pack`` addresses
this challenge by building archives from original conda package sources
and reproducing conda's own relocation logic.

Use Cases
---------

- Bundling an application with its environment for deployment

- Packaging a conda environment for use with Apache Spark when deploying on
  YARN (:doc:`see here <spark>` for more information).

- Packaging a conda environment for deployment on Apache YARN. One way to do
  this is to use `Skein <https://jcrist.github.io/skein/>`_.

- Archiving an environment in a functioning state. Note that a more sustainable
  way to do this is to specify your environment as a `environment.yml
  <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment>`_,
  and recreate the environment when needed.

- Packaging an environment as single executable with entrypoint to run on execution (see the
  instructions for :doc:`Linux and macOS <unix-binary>`).

- *BETA*: Packaging a conda environment as a standard Cloudera parcel. This is
  a newly added capability. It has been tested on a live cluster, but different
  cluster configurations may produce different results. We welcome users to
  `file an issue <https://github.com/conda/conda-pack/issues>`_ if necessary.
  :doc:`See here <parcel>` for more information).

Installation
------------

It's recommended to install in your root conda environment - the ``conda pack``
command will then be available in all sub-environments as well.

**Install with conda:**

``conda-pack`` is available from `Anaconda <https://anaconda.com>`_
as well as from `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_:

.. code::

    conda install conda-pack
    conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack


**Install from PyPI:**

While ``conda-pack`` requires an existing ``conda`` install, it can also be
installed from PyPI:

.. code::

    pip install conda-pack


**Install from source:**

``conda-pack`` is `available on github <https://github.com/conda/conda-pack>`_
and can always be installed from source.

.. code::

    pip install git+https://github.com/conda/conda-pack.git


Commandline Usage
-----------------

``conda-pack`` is primarily a commandline tool. Full CLI docs can be found
:doc:`here <cli>`.

One common use case is packing an environment on one machine to distribute to
other machines that may not have conda/python installed.

On the source machine

.. code-block:: bash

    # Pack environment my_env into my_env.tar.gz
    $ conda pack -n my_env

    # Pack environment my_env into out_name.tar.gz
    $ conda pack -n my_env -o out_name.tar.gz

    # Pack environment located at an explicit path into my_env.tar.gz
    $ conda pack -p /explicit/path/to/my_env

On the target machine

.. code-block:: bash

    # Unpack environment into directory `my_env`
    $ mkdir -p my_env
    $ tar -xzf my_env.tar.gz -C my_env

    # Use python without activating or fixing the prefixes. Most python
    # libraries will work fine, but things that require prefix cleanups
    # will fail.
    $ ./my_env/bin/python

    # Activate the environment. This adds `my_env/bin` to your path
    $ source my_env/bin/activate

    # Run python from in the environment
    (my_env) $ python

    # Cleanup prefixes from in the active environment.
    # Note that this command can also be run without activating the environment
    # as long as some version of python is already installed on the machine.
    (my_env) $ conda-unpack

    # At this point the environment is exactly as if you installed it here
    # using conda directly. All scripts should work fine.
    (my_env) $ ipython --version

    # Deactivate the environment to remove it from your path
    (my_env) $ source my_env/bin/deactivate


API Usage
---------

``conda-pack`` also provides a Python API, the full documentation of which can
be found :doc:`here <api>`. The API mostly mirrors that of the ``conda pack``
commandline. Repeating the examples from above:

.. code-block:: python

    import conda_pack

    # Pack environment my_env into my_env.tar.gz
    conda_pack.pack(name="my_env")

    # Pack environment my_env into out_name.tar.gz
    conda_pack.pack(name="my_env", output="out_name.tar.gz")

    # Pack environment located at an explicit path into my_env.tar.gz
    conda_pack.pack(prefix="/explicit/path/to/my_env")


Caveats
-------

This tool has a few caveats.

- Conda must be installed and be on your path.

- The OS where the environment was built must match the OS of the target.
  This means that environments built on Windows can't be relocated to Linux.

- Once an environment is unpacked and ``conda-unpack`` has been executed,
  it *cannot* be relocated. Re-applying ``conda-pack`` is unlikely to work.

- ``conda-pack`` is not well-suited for archiving old environments, because it
  requires that conda's package cache have all of the environment's packages
  present. It is intended for building archives from actively maintained
  conda environments.
