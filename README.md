# Conda-Pack

`conda-pack` is a command line tool for creating relocatable conda
environments. This is useful for deploying code in a consistent environment,
potentially in locations where python or conda isn't already installed.

See the <a href="https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/">documentation</a>
for more information.

Conda-pack is offered under a New BSD license; see the
